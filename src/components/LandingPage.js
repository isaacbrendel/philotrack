      <h1>Philosophical Foundations: A 19-Day Exploration of Western Thought</h1>

      This project documents an intensive 19-day journey through Bertrand Russell's "A History of Western Philosophy." It serves as a digital commonplace book, tracking progress and housing reflections on 955 pages of philosophical discourse. From the Pre-Socratics to 20th-century thinkers, this endeavor aims to distill centuries of wisdom, challenging our understanding of existence, knowledge, and ethics.
